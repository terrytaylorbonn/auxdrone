I began discussions with Auxiliumua.org (an American NGO) in October 2023 about working with Auxilium on drone projects in Ukraine. One of their projects is to build drones that can search for and classify mines (in mine fields). This project, and AI drones in general, really intrigued me. It would also be a good way to improve my Linux, Python and C++ skills. &#x20;

So I started to do some research.  At first I did AI examples (openCV, TensorFlow, Pytorch, etc.). My notes (docs 7a/b, 8, 9) are available on my Google Drive at  &#x20;

&#x20;    [drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CkfDvKPW6hg2nCAZjw19lLWQYFIuOu6Q](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CkfDvKPW6hg2nCAZjw19lLWQYFIuOu6Q)

I then started working on drone simulation. I had no previous drone experience, and I was working alone with only search engines, Youtube and StackOverflow as assistance. Detailed technical documentation is critical in such a situation. My main drone working files (.docx) are all located on my Gdrive (the chapters in this Gitbook correspond to documents on my Gdrive) at

&#x20;    [drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm)

The Gdrive documents are working documents that have all the critical details you need to build a drone from scratch with minimal experience.  It's not possible to use GitBook to create and manage such large and complicated documents. This GitBook website will be a "distilled" version of my working docs. Basically a conceptual overview that will introduce the drone concepts in a logical and orderly fashion. Something that I could not find on the internet.&#x20;
