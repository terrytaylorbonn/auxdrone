I started a project in late 2023 to build an AI capable drone.  I have no previous drone experience, and and I am working alone with no human assistance. Documentation is critical in such a situation. My main working files (.docx) are all located on my Gdrive (the chapters in this Gitbook match the docs on my Gdrive):

&#x20;    [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm)

The Gdrive documents may not be pretty, but if you actually start building an AI drone, you will quickly discover that they have  the accurate information you need.&#x20;

It's not possible to use GitBook to create and manage such information (too complicated). This GitBook website will be a "sanitized" version of my working docs. Something like a conceptual overview/guide that will intro the drone concepts in a logical and orderly fashion. Something that you will find nowhere else on the internet. Its a work in progress (WIP).
