# Intro (prologue)

I am building an AI drone. I am doing this to learn the core skills needed. This site is called "AuxDrone", because I am kind of cooperating with (not yet working for) a company whose name starts with "Aux". Auxdrone is a better name that AI drone (too generic).

I am working alone. With no human assistance. So it a lot of work. My main working files, notes, etc. (docs are critical when working alone) are all located on my Gdrive:

&#x20;    [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm)

The real source docs for all my detailed info are in MS.word. You can use GitBook to create and manage such info (too complicated). I like GitBook, but its not possible to use when documenting  very complex tasks (I know thats blasphemy, sorry).

This GitBook website will be a "sanitized" version of the docs. Something like a conceptual overview/guide that will intro the drone concepts in a logical/orderly fashion. Something that you will find nowhere on the internet. Its a work in progress (WIP, an acronym you will find often on this site).

Note: The chapters in this Gitbook match the docs on my Gdrive.
