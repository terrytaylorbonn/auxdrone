I am building an AI drone. I am doing this to learn the core skills needed. This site is called "AuxDrone", because I am kind of cooperating with (not yet working for) a company whose name starts with "Aux". Auxdrone is a better name than AI drone (too generic).

I am working alone. With no human assistance. A lot of work. Very complicated. Trial and error. Docs are critical in such a situation. Detailed docs stuffed with notes. My main working files (.docx) are all located on my Gdrive:

&#x20;    [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm)

The chapters in this Gitbook match the docs on my Gdrive.

Its not possible to use GitBook to create and manage such info (too complicated). This GitBook website will be a "sanitized" version of the docs. Something like a conceptual overview/guide that will intro the drone concepts in a logical/orderly fashion. Something that you will find nowhere on the internet. Its a work in progress (WIP, an acronym you will find often on this site).

The Gdrive documents may not be pretty, but if you actually start building an AI drone, you will quickly discover that they are a God-send. Detailed and accurate.  Much better than anything you find elsewhere (the docs on the official ArduPilot website are pure chaos).
