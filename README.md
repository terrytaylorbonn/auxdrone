I met with a representative of Auxiliumua.org in October 2023. We discussed Auxilium's NGO presence in Ukraine. One of their projects is to build drones that can search for and classify mines (in mine fields). I had some free time and decided to investigate AI and drones.&#x20;

At first I started doing AI examples (openCV, TensorFlow, Pytorch, etc.). My notes (docs 7a/b, 8, 9) are available at  &#x20;

I then started working on drone simulation. I had no previous drone experience, and I was working alone with no human assistance. Documentation is critical in such a situation. My main drone working files (.docx) are all located on my Gdrive (the chapters in this Gitbook match the docs on my Gdrive):

The Gdrive documents may not be pretty, but if you actually start building an AI drone, you will quickly discover that they have  the accurate information you need (please remember that this is a work in progress and that these documents are very draft).&#x20;

It's not possible to use GitBook to create and manage such large and complicated documents. This GitBook website will be a "sanitized" version of my working docs. Something like a conceptual overview/guide that will intro the drone concepts in a logical and orderly fashion. Something that you will find nowhere else on the internet.&#x20;
