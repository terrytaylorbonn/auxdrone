# Ch 1: SITL

SITL (software in the loop). Rather than using a real copter, you use a simulated copter (with a sim FC) in a sim world with sim objects. The rather complex installation and configuration of a simulation system is described in 1\_sim-all\_.docx (docs 1a and 1b contain extra topics) ([drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm)).
