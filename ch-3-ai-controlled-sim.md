# Ch 3: AI controlled sim

So now we have working AI object recognition on the real camera and real CC. The next step is connecting those to the sim FC and sim world, to verify that the python flight control program on the CC is not doing anything it should not do. That is the goal of the documents in this section. This is currently (mid-January 2024) my focus.&#x20;
