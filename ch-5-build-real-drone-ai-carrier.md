# Ch 5: Build real drone (AI carrier)

I plan to buy in a few weeks a Holybro drone kit and assemble and test fly. I will document the entire process in document 5\_drone-build\_.docx on the gdrive ([drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm)).

I call the drone an "AI carrier" because the AI is the real focus, the brains of our system. The drone is just the carrier platform.&#x20;
