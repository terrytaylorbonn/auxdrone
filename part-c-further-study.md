# PART C: Further study

After completing the main, there remains a lot more to learn. Docs for the following subjects will be stored on the Gdrive ([drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CkfDvKPW6hg2nCAZjw19lLWQYFIuOu6Q](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CkfDvKPW6hg2nCAZjw19lLWQYFIuOu6Q)):

* Add FPV (first person view) capability to drone.
* In Parts A and B, I went through the examples as quickly as possible to realize the goal (CC-controlled flight of real copter). I need to go back through and study a lot more topics in detail.
* More AI algorithm testing for specific types of drone mission (such as detecting mines).
* Study Mavlink flight commands (there are quite a few of them).
* Other ground control SW
* ROS / gazebo advanced (Lidar). ROS/ROS2 is quite complex. And although I did not need it (I think) for the AI object recognition, I will (I think) for adding a Lidar to the drone.
