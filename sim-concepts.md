# Sim concepts

The Gdrive ([drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx\_j\_y0GJ6\_RANR8Tjm)) document 0\_sim\_concepts\_.docx is my working document for creating text and diagrams that explain the major AI and drone concepts.&#x20;

This document is right now low priority. I will be better able to create the conceptual documentation after I have finished building and testing a drone. The only reason I want to create this document is because I could find no such document in the internet (that provided what I consider to be a good presentation of the subject).
